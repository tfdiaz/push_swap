# push_swap
## Efficient sorting with two quasi-stacks

Given an list of ints without duplicates as a paramater return the stack operations to make such list a sorted stack.

Constraints:
- Only two stacks can be used
- Each stack has operations:
  - Push to opposite stack
  - Pop
  - Rotate stack by one element
  - Reverse stack by one element
  - Swap top two elements
 
 ## Project Goals:
 - Understand time complexity
 - Stack manipulation
 - Simple visualizer build
